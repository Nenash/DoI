# 3.1 Wireframes - v0.2 (Approved)

**Project:** Bones on Ice - Web Edition v1.0
**Status:** Approved
**Audience:** UI/UX Designer, Frontend Developer, Graphics Engine Developer
**Purpose:** To provide the final, approved low-fidelity wireframes for all core application screens. This document defines the functional layout, information hierarchy, and component placement for the v1.0 release.

---

## 1. Overview

These v0.2 wireframes have been approved by the Creative Director. They incorporate feedback from the initial v0.1 draft to improve clarity and user flow. Key improvements include:
*   **Visual Team Rosters:** Providing an at-a-glance view of each team's status.
*   **Optimized UI Layout:** The Game Log has been moved to a less intrusive position, and the Contextual Player Info panel is now more prominent.

All high-fidelity design work and frontend development must be built upon this structure.

#### **Layout Annotations:**

*   **[1] Team Roster Panel:** Displays the four player icons for each team. The icon is highlighted when the corresponding player is selected. The icon is desaturated or greyed out after the player has taken their action for the round. This provides an immediate, visual turn tracker.
*   **[2] Selected Player:** The player token on the board receives a distinct visual treatment (e.g., a glow, an outline) when it is selected.
*   **[3] Player Info Panel (Contextual):** This panel is normally hidden. It appears (with a smooth transition) in the bottom-left corner only when a player token is selected, displaying that player's specific stats and role.
*   **[4] Player Action Panel:** This is the primary interaction hub. It displays the available actions for the selected player. Buttons for unavailable actions are in a `Disabled` state. The `ROLL DICE` button activates when a contested action is initiated.
*   **[5] Game Log:** A horizontal banner at the very bottom of the screen. It displays a running history of the most recent game events.
