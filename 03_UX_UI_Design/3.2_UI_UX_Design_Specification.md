# 3.2 UI/UX Design Specification

**Project:** Bones on Ice - Web Edition v1.0
**Audience:** UI/UX Designer, Frontend Developer
**Purpose:** To guide the creation of a high-fidelity, interactive user interface that is intuitive, aesthetically aligned with the project vision, and provides clear, immediate feedback to the player.

## 1. Core Vision & Design Pillars

Before designing any component, please internalize these three pillars. They are the foundation of all design decisions.

1.  **Aesthetic: "Cyber-Slavic Fantasy Sport"**
    *   **The World is Tech:** The UI, rink, and interface elements are clean, modern, and high-tech. Think glowing lines, sharp vectors, and a dark, high-contrast palette.
    *   **The Game is Ancient:** The dice are the one element that breaks the modern feel. They must look like tactile, carved bone with glowing runic numbers. The design must emphasize this contrast.

2.  **UX Philosophy: "Contextual & Uncluttered"**
    *   Information should be available when needed and hidden when not. The player should never feel overwhelmed. We achieve this through on-demand panels and clear hover states. The game board is the star of the show; the UI is its supporting cast.

3.  **Player Feeling: "Tactical & Tense"**
    *   The design must empower the player to feel like a smart tactician. It should provide all necessary information for strategic decisions. Key moments, like dice rolls, should be presented with a sense of tension and impact.

## 2. Global Design System (Required Components)

Please create a style guide that defines the following global elements:

*   **Typography:**
    *   **Header Font (H1, H2):** For major titles and screen headers. Must be modern and crisp (e.g., "Rajdhani", "Orbitron", or similar).
    *   **UI Body Font:** For all descriptive text, panels, and the game log. Legibility is paramount (e.g., "Roboto", "Inter").
    *   **Accent/Numeric Font:** For scores, stats, and dice numbers. Can be more stylized if it fits the "runic" theme, but must be instantly readable.

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary Background:** A dark, near-black color (e.g., `#0A0F14`).
    *   **Primary UI Color:** The main color for non-interactive UI panels and text (e.g., a cool grey `#A9BCCF`).
    *   **Accent/Interactive Color:** A vibrant, glowing color (e.g., electric blue `#00BFFF`) for buttons, hover states, and highlights.
    *   **Team Colors (x2):** Two distinct, high-contrast colors for Team A and Team B (e.g., neon orange `#FF5F1F` vs. sharp magenta `#DE00FF`).
    *   **Feedback Colors:** Standard positive (a vibrant green), negative (a sharp red), and neutral (a bright white/yellow) for visual feedback.

*   **Buttons:**
    *   Design a primary and secondary button style. Each must have four clear visual states:
        1.  `Default`: The standard, inactive state.
        2.  `Hover`: The state when the mouse is over the button (e.g., glows brighter, outline appears).
        3.  `Pressed`: The state when the button is being clicked (e.g., appears to push in).
        4.  `Disabled`: A clearly non-interactive state (e.g., greyed out, low opacity).

*   **Modals / Pop-ups:**
    *   Design a container style for pop-up windows. This will be used for the dice roll overlay, game options, and the end-of-match screen. It should fit the modern, minimalist HUD theme, likely with a semi-transparent dark background.

## 3. Screen-by-Screen Component Design

Based on the approved v0.2 wireframe, please design the following screens and components.

### 3.1. Main Menu & Team Selection Screens
*   **Task:** Design the initial user flow screens.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Team Icons:** Create six unique, minimalist/symbolic icons for the initial teams.
    *   **Selection Feedback:** The Team Selection screen needs strong visual feedback. The selected team's icon should have a distinct "selected" state, and the information panel should populate with a smooth, non-jarring transition (e.g., a quick fade-in).

### 3.2. Main Game Screen (The Rink)
This is the most critical screen. Every component must be designed with its interactive states in mind.

*   **Team Roster Panels (Top Corners):**
    *   Design the layout for the four player role icons (Attacker, Defender, Goalie).
    *   Each icon requires three visual states:
        1.  `Ready to Act`: Default active state.
        2.  `Selected`: When the player clicks on this token on the board.
        3.  `Has Acted`: A desaturated or greyed-out state.

*   **Player Info Panel (Bottom Left):**
    *   **Task:** Design this contextual panel to display player stats clearly.
    *   **UX Requirement:** This panel is normally hidden. Design its **"appear" and "disappear" transitions**. A smooth slide-in or fade-in from the bottom-left is required.

*   **Action Panel (Bottom Right):**
    *   **Task:** Design the container for player actions.
    *   **Requirement:** Ensure the button components (with all their states) are used here correctly. When an action is not available, its button must be in the `Disabled` state.

*   **Game Log (Bottom Banner):**
    *   **Task:** Design the look of the scrolling log.
    *   **Requirement:** Ensure the design accommodates multiple lines of text and is easy to read against the background. New entries should slide in from the right.

## 4. UX, Micro-interactions, and Player Feedback

The "feel" of the game is defined by how it communicates information. Your design must account for:

*   **Hover States:** **Everything interactive must have a hover state.** This includes player tokens on the board, buttons in the UI, and player icons in the roster panels. This is non-negotiable for usability.

*   **Visual Feedback on Key Events:** Design clear, immediate, and non-intrusive visual feedback for the following events:
    *   **Stamina Spent:** When a team's stamina decreases, the number should flash briefly or animate down.
    *   **Action Success:** A brief, positive-colored flash (e.g., green) or particle effect on the acting token.
    *   **Action Failure / Block:** A brief, negative-colored flash (e.g., red) or a "shield" impact effect.
    *   **Zone Bonus Active:** The zone on the board must glow clearly, and a `+2` icon should appear.
    *   **Goal Scored:** This is a major event. It needs a high-impact, full-screen visual effect (e.g., a flash of the team's color).

*   **Transitions:**
    *   Panels should not just appear/disappear; they should use smooth transitions (fades, slides, ~200-300ms).
    *   The transition between the main game screen and a full-screen modal (like the end-of-game summary) should be seamless.

## 5. Final Deliverables

1.  **High-Fidelity Mockup:** A pixel-perfect design of the complete **Main Game Screen**. This will serve as the visual benchmark for the entire project.
2.  **Supporting Screen Mockups:** Mockups for the Main Menu, Team Selection, and Post-Match screens.
3.  **A Comprehensive Style Guide:** This document is the handoff to the development team. It must include:
    *   The full color palette with HEX codes.
    *   Typography rules (font families, sizes, weights).
    *   Final designs for all button states.
    *   All icons and assets, provided in a scalable format (e.g., SVG).
