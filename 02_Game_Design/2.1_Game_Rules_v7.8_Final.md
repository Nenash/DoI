# 2.1 Game Rules - v7.8 "Polished Edition"

**Project:** Bones on Ice - Web Edition v1.0
**Audience:** Players
**Purpose:** To provide the complete, official rules for playing the game.

---

## 1. Overview & Objective

Welcome to **Bones on Ice**, a tactical hockey game for two players. You will take command of a unique team of four players, using a shared pool of stamina, strategic positioning, and a powerful **Team Spirit** to outmaneuver your opponent.

**The objective is simple: score more goals than your opponent by the end of 15 rounds.**

## 2. The Rink

The game is played on a rink divided into three main zones:
*   **Your Defensive Zone:** (Also your opponent's Attack Zone)
*   **The Neutral Zone**
*   **Your Attack Zone:** (Also your opponent's Defensive Zone)

Positioning your players in these zones is key to gaining an advantage.

## 3. Core Mechanics

### 3.1. Team Composition
Each team consists of four players:
*   **1 Attacker:** Your primary goal scorer.
*   **2 Defenders:** Your versatile skaters, good at both offense and defense.
*   **1 Goalie:** Your last line of defense.

### 3.2. Team Stamina
*   Each team has a shared pool of **20 Stamina**. This is the most critical resource in the game.
*   Stamina is spent to perform special actions like **Passing** (`1 Stamina`), **Boosting** a roll (`+2` for `1 Stamina`), or using your powerful **Team Spirit** ability.

### 3.3. Contested Rolls
*   Most actions, like moving past an opponent or making a shot, are resolved with a contested dice roll. Both players roll their relevant stat die (e.g., `Reflexes` vs. `Reflexes`).
*   **The Golden Rule:** The player *initiating* the action is the "Attacker." The player reacting is the "Defender." If the roll results in a tie, **the Defender always wins.**
*   The only exception is the **Face-Off**, which is re-rolled on a tie.

## 4. The Round Structure

Each of the 15 rounds is played in a sequence of phases.

### 4.1. Phase 1: Face-Off
*   To start the round, both players choose one skater to compete for the puck. They both roll for **Reflexes**.
*   The highest roll wins the puck and their team becomes the "active team" for the turn.

### 4.2. Phase 2: Mid-Game (Active Team's Turn)
*   The active team now takes one action with each of their three skaters (Attacker and 2 Defenders). The Goalie does not act here.
*   **Available Actions:**
    *   **Move:** Attempt to move into an adjacent zone with the puck. This is a contested **Reflexes** roll and costs 0 stamina.
    *   **Shoot on Goal:** Attempt to shoot the puck. This is a contested **Marksmanship** vs. **Reflexes** roll.
    *   **Pass:** Spend `1 Stamina` to pass the puck to a teammate in the same or an adjacent zone. The opponent can spend `1 Stamina` to try and intercept with a contested **Reflexes** roll.
    *   **Tactical Move:** Spend `1 Stamina` to move a player *without* the puck to an adjacent zone.

### 4.3. Phase 3: 1v1 (Shot vs. Goalie)
*   If a shot on goal gets past the defending skaters, it enters a 1v1 showdown.
*   The attacker rolls **Marksmanship** vs. the Goalie's **Reflexes**.
*   **Attacker's roll > Goalie's roll:** It's a **GOAL!**
*   **Goalie's roll â‰¥ Attacker's roll:** It's a **SAVE.** After a save, the puck is contested. The attacker and goalie both roll **Reflexes** for the rebound. The winner gets the puck.

### 4.4. Phase 4: Recovery
*   At the end of the round, both teams recover **8 Stamina** (up to the max of 20).
*   **Exhaustion:** If a team's stamina pool dropped to 0 at any point during the round, they are "Exhausted" and only recover **4 Stamina**.
*   The round counter advances.

## 5. Zonal Bonuses
*   **Attack Bonus:** When you take a shot on goal from *within your Attack Zone*, you get **+2** to your Marksmanship roll.
*   **Defense Bonus:** When you are defending against any action *within your own Defensive Zone*, you get **+2** to your Reflexes roll.

## 6. The Chaos Table
*   At the start of rounds 5, 10, and 15, fate intervenes! A random event from the Chaos Table is automatically triggered, which can dramatically change the game by awarding a penalty shot, scrambling player positions, or granting a powerful bonus.

## 7. Winning the Game
*   The player with the most goals after 15 rounds is declared the winner.
*   If the score is tied, the game is decided by a series of 3 tie-breaking "shootout" rounds.
