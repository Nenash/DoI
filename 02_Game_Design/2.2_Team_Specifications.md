**Project:** Bones on Ice - Web Edition v1.0
**Audience:** Players, Developers
**Purpose:** To provide a structured and definitive list of all playable teams, their player stats, and their unique Team Spirit abilities.

## Overview

Each team is composed of **1 Attacker**, **2 Defenders**, and **1 Goalie**. A player's stats are represented by the die they roll for that action (e.g., d6, d8, d10). A `+X` indicates a static bonus added to every roll for that stat. All costs for Team Spirit abilities are paid from the shared **Team Stamina** pool.
