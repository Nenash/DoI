## Match Setup

This demonstration covers the first three rounds of a tense match between two teams with very different strategies:

*   **Team B:** **Ветры Севера (Northern Winds)** - A patient, shutdown defensive team.

---

### **Round 1: The Opening Gambit**

**Initial State:**
*   **Score:** 0-0
*   **Svarog Stamina:** 20
*   **Winds Stamina:** 20

#### **Pre-Round Phase**
Svarog's player wants to apply immediate pressure. He activates his **Team Spirit**, spending **2 Stamina** to give his Attacker, "Volkhv Ogneyar," `+1` to all rolls this round.
*   *Svarog Stamina: 18*

#### **Phase 1: Face-Off**
The puck drops in the Neutral Zone. Svarog's Defender (Reflexes d6) faces off against the Winds' Defender (Reflexes d8).
*   Svarog rolls a 5.
*   Winds roll a 3.
**Result:** Svarog wins the face-off! His Defender gets the puck.

#### **Phase 2: Mid-Game (Svarog's Turn)**
1.  **Svarog's Defender (with puck)** attempts a **Move** into the Winds' zone. He is opposed by a Winds Defender (Reflexes d8).
    *   Svarog (Attacker, d6) rolls a 4.
    *   Winds (Defender, d8) rolls a 6.
    **Result:** The move fails! The defender's roll is higher. The puck remains in the Neutral Zone.

2.  **Svarog's Attacker "Volkhv Ogneyar" (no puck)** makes a tactical move. He spends **1 Stamina** to move into the attack zone, positioning himself for a future pass.
    *   *Svarog Stamina: 17*

#### **Phase 4: Recovery**
Both teams recover Stamina.
*   **Svarog Stamina:** 17 + 8 -> 20 (capped at max).
*   **Winds Stamina:** 20 (already max).

**End of Round 1. The score remains 0-0.** Svarog's initial push was blunted, but they are positioned aggressively.

### **Round 2: The Winds Strike Back**

**Initial State:**
*   **Score:** 0-0
*   **Svarog Stamina:** 20
*   **Winds Stamina:** 20

#### **Phase 1: Face-Off**
The Winds win the face-off this time and get possession of the puck in the Neutral Zone.

#### **Phase 2: Mid-Game (Winds' Turn)**
1.  **The Winds' Attacker (with puck)** attempts a **Move** into Svarog's zone.
    *   Winds (Attacker, d8) rolls a 6.
    *   Svarog (Defender, d6) rolls a 2.
    **Result:** Success! The Winds' Attacker breaks into the zone and prepares to shoot.

2.  **The Winds' Attacker takes a Shot on Goal.** This shot is from within his Attack Zone, so he gets a `+2` bonus.
    *   **Shot vs. Defender:** The shot must first get past Svarog's Defender.
        *   Winds' Attacker (Marksmanship d8) rolls a 5. With the `+2` bonus, his total is **7**.
        *   Svarog's Defender (Reflexes d6) gets a `+2` bonus for defending in his own zone. He rolls a 4. His total is **6**.
    **Result:** 7 vs 6. The shot gets through!

#### **Phase 3: 1v1 (Shot vs. Goalie)**
Now it's a showdown between the shooter and Svarog's Goalie, "Zhar-Stoykiy."
*   The Winds' Attacker (d8) still gets his `+2` zone bonus. He rolls a 6. His final shot value is **8**.
*   Svarog's Goalie (Reflexes d10+1) rolls a 5. His final save value is **6**.
**Result:** 8 vs 6. **GOAL! The Northern Winds take a 1-0 lead!**

**End of Round 2. The score is 0-1.** The Winds' patient play pays off with the first goal of the game.

### **Round 3: The Unbreakable Wall**

**Initial State:**
*   **Score:** 0-1
*   **Svarog Stamina:** 20
*   **Winds Stamina:** 20

#### **Phase 1: Face-Off**
Svarog, determined to equalize, wins the face-off. Their star Attacker, "Volkhv Ogneyar," gets the puck.

#### **Phase 2: Mid-Game (Svarog's Turn)**
1.  **"Volkhv Ogneyar" (with puck)** immediately attempts a **Move** into the attack zone. He is opposed by a Winds' Defender (Reflexes d8).
    *   Svarog (Attacker, d8) rolls a 7.
    *   Winds (Defender, d8) rolls a 2.

    This looks like an easy success for Svarog...
    **BUT!** The Winds' player declares they are using their **Team Spirit**. The Defender gets a free `+6` bonus to his defensive roll.
    *   The Defender's new total is 2 + 6 = **8**.

**Result:** 7 (Svarog) vs 8 (Winds). The attack is completely shut down! The Winds' powerful ability turns a guaranteed failure into a decisive success, at no stamina cost.

**End of Round 3. The score remains 0-1.** Svarog's offense is neutralized by the signature defensive power of the Northern Winds.
