## 1. Project Vision & Core Principle

Our goal is to create a game that feels both intellectually satisfying and viscerally thrilling. The entire creative execution must serve our core principle:

> "The intellectual satisfaction of having tactically outmaneuvered an opponent, combined with the thrill of dice rolls—a game where a cold mind and hot dice team up for the win."

## 2. The Guiding Aesthetic: "Cyber-Slavic Fantasy Sport"

This is the central creative concept. Our visual identity is built on a powerful **dichotomy**: the fusion of a clean, futuristic digital sports arena with the raw, ancient power of mystical artifacts.

Every creative decision should amplify this contrast. The player should feel like they are a high-tech commander, wielding primal forces in a digital world.

## 3. Visual Execution - The "Tech" (The Arena & UI)

This part of the design represents the "cold mind"—it is clean, functional, and modern.

### 3.1. Rink & Environment
*   **Mood:** A high-tech, digital sports arena. Think e-sports stage, not a traditional ice rink.
*   **Color Palette:** High-contrast and bold. The base should be a dark, near-black background, brought to life with vibrant, glowing, **electric colors** (e.g., electric blue, neon orange, sharp magenta) for rink lines and highlights.
*   **Surface:** The "ice" surface should be clean and dark. A subtle, underlying geometric pattern (like hexagons or circuit board traces) with a low-opacity glow will reinforce the tech vibe.

### 3.2. UI/UX
*   **Philosophy:** The UI is a minimalist, functional **Heads-Up Display (HUD)**. It provides information without distracting from the game board.
*   **Style:** A flat design philosophy with sharp corners and clean lines. Panels should have semi-transparent dark backgrounds.
*   **Typography:** We will use a crisp, modern, sans-serif font that is highly legible.

### 3.3. Player Tokens
*   **Style:** Minimalist and symbolic. The tokens are clean, geometric shapes or stylized icons that clearly represent their role (Attacker, Defender, Goalie) and team color. They should look like digital projections or solid-state game pieces, consistent with the tech theme.

## 4. Visual Execution - The "Bones" (The Dice & Magic)

This part of the design represents the "hot dice"—it is ancient, tactile, and powerful. The dice are the most important thematic element and must stand in stark visual contrast to the modern environment.

### 4.1. The Dice
*   **Material:** The dice must be rendered to look as if they are carved from **aged, off-white bone**. They need to feel ancient and powerful, with visible texture, small cracks, and imperfections.
*   **Numbers:** The numbers on the dice are not simple pips. They should be represented by **glowing, runic symbols** in one of the key highlight colors (e.g., electric blue). This connects them to the tech world while affirming their mystical nature.
*   **The Key Moment:** The animation of these primal, tactile objects tumbling across the clean, digital interface is the defining visual hook of the game.

### 4.2. Team Spirit VFX
*   The visual effects for Team Spirit abilities should also lean into the "Slavic Fantasy" theme. They should feel like bursts of ancient magic: fiery runes, swirling snow, crackling lightning, or ghostly apparitions that briefly manifest on the clean, digital rink.

## 5. Audio Direction

The audio will also follow this core dichotomy.

*   **Music:** (To be provided by the Creative Director) The music will set the overall epic tone.
*   **Sound Effects (SFX):**
    *   **UI Sounds:** Must be sharp, digital, and clean. Clicks, hovers, and notifications should sound like interacting with a futuristic HUD.
    *   **Game Action Sounds:** Must be tactile and impactful.
        *   **Dice Rolls:** The sound of bone clattering on a hard surface.
        *   **Puck Movement:** A sharp, energetic "swoosh."
        *   **Blocks/Checks:** A solid, impactful "thud" or energy shield sound.
        *   **Goal Scored:** A powerful, resonant sound that combines a digital chime with a primal impact.

## 6. Summary: The Core Contrast

To succeed, we must consistently emphasize the following contrasts:

*   **Modern** (UI, Rink) vs. **Ancient** (Dice, Magic)
*   **Clean & Vector-based** (Interface) vs. **Textured & Organic** (Dice)
*   **Digital & Cold** (Arena) vs. **Mystical & Primal** (Game Pieces)

This synergy will create a unique and memorable identity for "Bones on Ice."
