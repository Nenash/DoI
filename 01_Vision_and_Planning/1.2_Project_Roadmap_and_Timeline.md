# 1.2 Project Roadmap and Timeline

**Project:** Bones on Ice - Web Edition v1.0
**Audience:** All Team Members (Development, Design, Creative)
**Purpose:** To establish a clear and realistic timeline for the project, define the major phases of work, and set expectations for key milestones and deliverables.

---

## 1. High-Level Summary

The project is estimated to take **7 to 8 weeks** from the end of the specification phase to the public launch of the v1.0 hotseat game.

This timeline is structured into three distinct phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Visual Design & Prototyping** (2 Weeks)
2.  **Phase 2: Core Development & Implementation** (4 Weeks)
3.  **Phase 3: Testing & Deployment** (1-2 Weeks)

This schedule is aggressive but achievable, assuming prompt feedback at review milestones and clear communication across all teams.

## 2. Detailed Phase Breakdown

### **Phase 1: Visual Design & Prototyping (Estimated: 2 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To finalize the game's visual identity and create all necessary assets for development.

*   **Week 1: High-Fidelity Mockups & Asset Creation**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   The Art Team will create the first draft of the main game screen mockup based on the "Cyber-Slavic Fantasy Sport" brief.
        *   Creation of initial core assets will begin: team icons, token designs, and the critical "bony" dice model/sprite.
        *   The Creative Director will provide the first draft of the background music track.
    *   **Milestone:** **Mockup v1 Review.** A mandatory review session with the Creative Director to provide feedback on the visual direction.

*   **Week 2: Final Assets & UI Style Guide**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Incorporate feedback into the final mockup.
        *   Create all remaining game assets (buttons, panels, fonts, etc.) based on the approved style.
        *   The UI/UX Designer will develop a formal **UI Style Guide** document. This will be the bible for the UI developer.
    *   **Milestone:** **All v1.0 visual assets are complete and signed off.** The "look" of the game is now locked, and all assets are delivered to the development team.

### **Phase 2: Core Development & Implementation (Estimated: 4 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To build a feature-complete and functional alpha version of the game.

*   **Weeks 3-4: The Game Engine & Board Interaction**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Set up the core project architecture (Vue/React + PixiJS).
        *   Implement the `GraphicsEngine` to render the static board and interactive player tokens.
        *   Implement the core `GameEngine` with its state machine (tracking turns, rounds, score).
        *   Load all team data from the external JSON files.
    *   **Milestone:** **A "Headless" Prototype.** A functional board where pieces can be moved and the game engine correctly tracks their state, without the full UI overlay.

*   **Weeks 5-6: UI, Rules Logic & Final Polish**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   The UI Developer will implement all UI panels based on the Style Guide (Team Rosters, Action Panel, Game Log, etc.).
        *   The Game Logic Developer will code the complete rules engine: contested rolls, stamina costs, all 6 Team Spirit abilities, and the Chaos Table events.
        *   The Graphics Engine Developer will implement the dice rolling animation and all VFX.
        *   Integrate sound effects and music.
        *   Implement the `LocalStorageManager` for tracking player stats.
    *   **Milestone:** **Feature-Complete Alpha.** The game is playable from start to finish, with all rules and features implemented as specified.

### **Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Estimated: 1-2 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To ensure a stable, polished, and bug-free product is delivered to the public.

*   **Week 7: Quality Assurance (QA) & Bug Fixing**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Intensive internal playtesting by the entire team to identify bugs, rule inconsistencies, edge cases, and usability issues.
        *   All identified bugs will be logged, prioritized, and assigned.
        *   The development team will focus exclusively on fixing all critical and major bugs.
    *   **Milestone:** **Release Candidate.** A stable, polished version of the game is deemed ready for launch.

*   **Week 8: Final Polish & Deployment**
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Final polish based on testing feedback (e.g., minor timing adjustments, UI tweaks).
        *   Deployment of the final build to the web host.
        *   Final checks on the live production environment.
    *   **Milestone:** **v1.0 is LIVE.**
